 > As you start to walk out on the way, the way appears - Rumi.


  This phrase reminds me that the path to my goals and dreams is not always clear or easy to see. It can be intimidating to take the first steps toward something new, especially when unsure of what lies ahead. But in these moments of uncertainty, I must have faith and trust in myself and my ability to navigate any challenges that may arise.

  As I move forward, the path may become clearer, and I may start seeing opportunities and resources previously hidden from view. This is because as I take action and put myself out there, I open myself up to new experiences and connections that can help me along the way. I may meet people who offer guidance or come across information or resources that can help me achieve my goals.

  This phrase reminds me to trust the journey and have faith in myself and my abilities. It is a reminder that the path to my goals often becomes clearer and more accessible as I take the first steps toward them. So I shouldn't be afraid to take that first step, even if I am unsure of what lies ahead. I should trust that the way will appear as I begin to walk out on it.
